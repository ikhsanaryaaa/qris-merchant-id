# ShopeePay token — paste a manual `B:...` token (B1)

B1 has no login flow yet (programmatic OTP arrives in B2), so you paste the
merchant token from your own logged-in partner portal session — the same recipe
the `shoppepay-api-gateway` reference uses.

## Grab the token (2 minutes, your browser)

1. Log in to `https://partner.shopee.co.id` as usual.
2. Open DevTools → Network tab.
3. Open the ShopeePay transaction history page (fires
   `get-transaction-list`).
4. Click that request → Request Payload → `data` → `metadata` → `token`.
5. Copy the value (starts with `B:`).

```python
from qrismerchantid import ShopeePayPartner

sp = ShopeePayPartner(token="B:paste-yours-here")
print(sp.stores.list_stores())
```

## Rules

- The token lives in YOUR `.env` (`SHOPEE_TOKEN=...`) — it is only ever sent
  to Shopee's own servers. Never commit it.
- Tokens rotate when the portal session refreshes: when calls start failing
  with `200020`/`2010000` ("Shopee rejected the saved session"), paste a fresh
  one. B2 will automate renewal.
- Multi-store: each storefront session has its own token — construct one
  `ShopeePayPartner` per token.

Prefer zero copy-paste? Log in programmatically instead — [auth.md](auth.md).
