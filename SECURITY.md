## Reporting a vulnerability

(offline, no real credentials), and impact assessment. Please do not open public issues
for vulnerabilities.

## Handling secrets safely with this SDK

- `top_up_debit_prepare()` sends raw card data — never log request bodies on that path.
- The PIN is RSA-encrypted in transit, but it exists in plaintext in your process memory:
  read it via `getpass`, never hardcode it, never log it.
- `.ovo-token.json` / `.ovo-otp-pending.json` are git-ignored for a reason — keep them
  out of repos, screenshots, and issue reports.
- Session tokens live ~24 h; treat them like passwords.
